Several months ago I published [Gladys the Corgi](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/50164) which aimed to add my own dog into Skyrim. I had a lot of fun making it, but there was one problem: I have another dog! For the longest time the lack of a proper Cardigan Corgi asset kept me from working on this mod, however, a few weeks ago [Jelidity](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/4569617) ﻿kindly provided me with a lovely model that fit my needs perfectly.

When designing this mod I did not want it to turn into a reskinned Gladys, so I set out to make sure the two companions behaved differently. Gladys was a merchant dog, so she is very good at hoarding items and carrying them for you. This new follower, Merlin, will live up to his name by being a combat-oriented follower that can utilized an arsenal of magical attacks.

Travel to the [Summoning Circle](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/elderscrolls/images/9/92/Summoning_Stones_Map.png/revision/latest?cb=20130804223114) just north of Morthal to meet your new friend. Merlin is ready to join you on your adventure and protect you with tooth and spell!
